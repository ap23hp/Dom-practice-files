//Typical use: Run JS that manipulates the DOM without waiting for images or CSS.
//Faster than waiting for the full load event.

        addEventListener('load', (event) => {
            console.log('The page is fully loaded.');
        });
//Typical use:
//Run code that depends on images or other resources being fully available.
//Initialize things like slideshows or image-heavy layouts.

        addEventListener('beforeunload', (event) => {
            // show the confirmation dialog
            event.preventDefault();
            // Google Chrome requires returnValue to be set.
            event.returnValue = '';
        });
//When it fires:Right before the user leaves the page (closing tab, refreshing, navigating away).
//Typical use:
//Warn the user about unsaved changes.
//Ask for confirmation before leaving.
        addEventListener('unload', (event) => {
            // send analytic data
        });

        //When it fires:After the document is being unloaded (navigation away or close).
//Typical use:Send analytics, save session info, clean up resources.
//You can’t stop navigation here — it’s purely for cleanup.
